    <h2>1. What is Discrete Math?</h2>
    <p><strong>Discrete Mathematics</strong> deals with mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. Unlike calculus, which studies smooth and continuous change, discrete math focuses on integers, logic, graphs, combinatorics, and probability‚Äîobjects that are distinct and separate.</p>
    <p>It is often called the <strong>language of computer science</strong>, since computers operate in the binary world of 0s and 1s.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Core Topics in Discrete Math</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logic & Proofs</strong>: Foundation of program conditions and algorithm correctness.</li>
      <li><strong>Boolean Algebra</strong>: The algebra of 0 and 1. Basis for digital circuits and computer operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Set Theory & Functions</strong>: Mathematical backbone of databases, data structures, and hash maps.</li>
      <li><strong>Graph Theory</strong>: Directly connected to networks, social graphs, and path-finding algorithms.</li>
      <li><strong>Number Theory</strong>: Modular arithmetic, prime numbers ‚Üí essential for modern cryptography (e.g., RSA).</li>
      <li><strong>Combinatorics & Probability</strong>: Counting and probability ‚Üí used in security, algorithm analysis, and ML models.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms & Complexity</strong>: Big-O notation and performance analysis ‚Üí critical for efficient code.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Why is it important for CS?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Programming</strong>: Conditionals and loops are directly tied to propositional logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: RSA encryption starts from modular arithmetic and prime testing.</li>
      <li><strong>AI / Machine Learning</strong>: Probability and linear algebra are the mathematical language of ML.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Sorting, searching, graph traversal all require discrete math thinking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Without discrete math, it is difficult to deeply understand computer science.</em></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Why I want to learn it</h2>
    <p>I don‚Äôt just want to learn how to use programming languages. I want to answer deeper questions like: <em>‚ÄúWhy is this code efficient?‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúWhy does security rely on mathematical properties?‚Äù</em></p>
    <p>Through discrete math, I aim to move beyond simply writing <strong>working code</strong> toward creating <strong>proven, secure, and efficient code</strong>.</p>
